This experiment is designed for the following use-cases.

- Load test
- Benchmark
- Validate service level objectives (SLOs)
- Safe rollout
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)

If the gRPC service satisfies SLOs, it may be safely rolled out, for example, from a test environment to production.
