# Benchmark and Validate HTTP Services

!!! tip "Overview"
    Use Iter8's `load-test-http` experiment chart to generate call requests for HTTP services, collect Iter8's built-in latency and error-related metrics, and validate service-level objectives (SLOs).

    ***

    **Use-cases:** 
    
    - Benchmarking
    - Validation of service level objectives (SLOs)
    - Safe rollouts
    - Continuous delivery (CD)
    
    If the HTTP service satisfies SLOs, it may be safely rolled out, for example, from a test environment to production.

???+ warning "Before you begin"
    1. [Install Iter8 CLI](../../getting-started/install.md).
    2. Run the [httpbin](https://httpbin.org) service from a separate terminal.
    ```shell
    docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
    ```
    You can also use [Podman](https://podman.io) or other alternatives to Docker in the above command.

***

## Basic example
[Your first experiment](../../getting-started/your-first-experiment.md) provides a basic example of using the `load-test-http` experiment chart. This tutorial describes various ways to parameterize `load-test-http`.

***

## Metrics and SLOs
By default, the following metrics are collected by `load-test-http`: 

- `request-count`: total number of requests sent
- `error-count`: number of error responses
- `error-rate`: fraction of error responses
- `latency-mean`: mean of observed latency values
- `latency-stddev`: standard deviation of observed latency values
- `latency-min`: min of observed latency values
- `latency-max`: max of observed latency values
- `latency-pX`: X^th^ percentile of observed latency values, for `X` in `[50.0, 75.0, 90.0, 95.0, 99.0, 99.9]`

In addition, any other latency percentiles that are specified as part of SLOs are also collected. 

***

```shell
iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
          --set url=http://127.0.0.1/get \
          --set SLOs.error-rate=0 \
          --set SLOs.latency-mean=50 \
          --set SLOs.latency-p90=100 \
          --set SLOs.latency-p'97\.5'=200
```

In the above example, The following SLOs are validated.

- error rate is 0
- mean latency is under 50 msec
- 90th percentile latency is under 100 msec
- 97.5th percentile latency is under 200 msec

***

### Report

The Iter8 experiment report contains metric values, and SLO validation results. View it as follows.

=== "HTML"
    ```shell
    iter8 report -o html > report.html
    # open report.html with a browser. In MacOS, you can use the command:
    # open report.html
    ```

=== "Text"
    ```shell
    iter8 report
    ```

***

### Assert
The `iter8 assert` subcommand asserts if experiment result satisfies the specified conditions. If assert conditions are satisfied, it exits with code `0`; else, it exits with code `1`. Assertions are especially useful within CI/CD/GitOps pipelines.

Assert that the experiment completed without failures, and all SLOs are satisfied.
```shell
iter8 assert -c completed -c nofailure -c slos
```

???+ note "Sample output from assert"
    ```shell
    INFO[2021-11-10 09:33:12] experiment completed
    INFO[2021-11-10 09:33:12] experiment has no failure                    
    INFO[2021-11-10 09:33:12] SLOs are satisfied                           
    INFO[2021-11-10 09:33:12] all conditions were satisfied
    ```
***

## Load profile
    
Control the characteristics of the load generated by the `load-test-http` experiment by setting the number of queries (`numQueries`), duration (`duration`), the number of queries sent per second (`qps`), and the number of parallel connections used to send queries  (`connections`).

=== "Number of queries"
    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/get \
              --set numQueries=200 \
              --set qps=10 \
              --set connections=5
    ```

=== "Duration"
    The duration value may be any [Go duration string](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration).

    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/get \
              --set duration=20s \
              --set qps=10 \
              --set connections=5
    ```

When you set `numQueries` and `qps`, the duration of the load test is automatically determined. Similarly, when you set the `duration` and `qps`, the number of queries to be sent is automatically determined. If you set both `numQueries` and `duration`, the latter will be ignored.

***

## Payload
Send any type of content as payload during the load test of HTTP POST endpoints, either by specifying the payload as a string (`payloadStr`), or by specifying a URL for Iter8 to fetch the payload from (`payloadURL`). You can also specify the HTTP Content Type header (`contentType`).

=== "string"
    When `payloadStr` is set, content type is set to `application/octet-stream` by default.
    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/post \
              --set payloadStr="abc123"
    ```

=== "string with contentType"
    Set content type to `text/plain`.
    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/post \
              --set payloadStr="abc123" \
              --set contentType="text/plain"
    ```

=== "JSON from URL"
    Fetch JSON content from a URL. Use this JSON as payload. Set content type to `application/json`.
    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/post \
              --set payloadURL=https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street-dates \
              --set contentType="application/json"
    ```

=== "image from URL"
    Fetch jpeg image from a URL. Use this image as payload. Set content type to `image/jpeg`.
    ```shell
    iter8 launch -c load-test-http \
              --set url=http://127.0.0.1/post \
              --set payloadURL=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/09/08/17/58/poppy-6607526_1280.jpg \
              --set contentType="image/jpeg"
    ```
