# Performance testing a ML model

You can load test an ML model deployed to KServe ModelMesh similar to performance testing other gRPC methods. See the [Single gRPC method](../../performance/load-test-grpc.md) tutorial or the [Load test a KServe model (via gRPC)](../kserve/grpc.md) tutorial for examples.
