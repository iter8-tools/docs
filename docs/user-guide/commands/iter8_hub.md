## iter8 hub

Download an experiment chart from an Iter8 experiment chart repo

### Synopsis


Download an experiment chart from an Iter8 experiment chart repo.
This is useful for fetching experiment charts to inspect, modify, launch, or repackage. 
The official Iter8 experiment chart repo is located at: https://iter8-tools.github.io/hub
By default, the hub command looks for the specified chart in the official Iter8 chart repo. 
You can use third party chart repos by supplying the repo URL flag.

Note: 
	The hub subcommand is primarily designed for Iter8 development use-cases.
	End-users are expected to use the launch subcommand.
