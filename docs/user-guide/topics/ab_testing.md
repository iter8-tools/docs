# A/B/n Testing

A/B/n testing relies on business metrics typically computed by a frontend, user-facing, application component. Metric values often depend on one or more interactions with backend (not user-facing) components. To A/B/n test a backend component, it is necessary to be able to associate a metric value (computed by the frontend) to the version of the backend component that contributed to its computation. The challenge is that the frontend service often does not know which version of the backend component processed a given request.
To address this challenge, Iter8 introduces an A/B/n SDK which provides a frontend service with two APIs:

a. **Lookup()** - Identifies a version of a backend component to send a request to. Given a user session, *Lookup()* returns a track identifier that can be used to route requests. So long as there are no changes in configuration, the track identifier (and hence route) will be same for the same user session, guaranteeing session stickiness. Note that the track identifier is not a version identifier; the version associated with a track changes over time as the versions being tested chanage.

b. **WriteMetric()** - Associates a metric value with a backend component. Given a user session, *WriteMetric()* identifies the implementing version and writes the metric to a metric store associated with that version. By default, Iter8 uses a Kubernetes secret to store the metrics. The [abnmetrics](../tasks/abnmetrics.md) experiment task can be used to read the metrics stored by *WriteMetric()*.

The Iter8 SDK is implemented using gRPC. The formal defintion of the API is in this [protocol buffer document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/docs/v0.13.1/samples/abn-sample/frontend/abn.proto).

## Deploying the Implementing Service

An Iter8 A/B/n service implements the gRPC API. This service is configured, at deployment, to watch the resoruce objects for a set of applications.

To watch for versions of an application, specify the list of the types of the objects that must be present and ready for a version to be considered ready:

`--set "apps.<namespace>.<application_name>.resources={<comma separated list resoure types>}"`

Valid resource types are:

| Type Name | Kubernetes Resource Type (GVR) | Required Status |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| service  | v1 services | - |
| deployment | apps/v1 deployments | Available |
| ksvc | serving.knative.dev/v1 services | Ready |

If more than one candidate version is expected, specify the number using:

`--set apps.<namespace>.<application_name>.maxNumCandidates=<integer>`

Iter8 extrapolates from this information the names of the exported resource objects using these assumptions:

- All objects for all versions are deployed in the same namespace
- There is only 1 resource object of a given type in each version
- All objects in the baseline vers√üion are named using only the application name
- All objects in a candidate version are named as <application_name>-candidate-<index> where index is 1, 2, etc.
- The baseline track label is the name of the application
- Candidate track labels are of the form <application_name>-candidate-<index>

## Developing Frontends: Using the SDK

The basic steps to author a frontend application component using the Iter8 SDK are outlined below for *Node.js* and *Go*. Similar steps would be required for any gRPC supported langauge.

### Use/Import language specific libraries

The gRPC protocol buffer definition is used to generate language specific implementation. These files can be used directly or packaged and imported as a library. As examples, the Node.js sample uses manually generated files directly. The Go sample imports the library provided by the core Iter8 implementation. In addition to the API specific methods, some general gRPC libaries are required.

=== "Node.js"
    The manually generated node files [`abn_pd.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/docs/v0.13.0/samples/abn-sample/frontend/node/abn_pb.js) and [`abn_grpc_pb.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iter8-tools/docs/v0.13.0/samples/abn-sample/frontend/node/abn_grpc_pb.js) used used in the sample application can be copied and used without modification in other projects.

    ```shell
    var grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');

    var messages = require('./abn_pb.js');
    var services = require('./abn_grpc_pb.js');
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
    import (
	    "google.golang.org/grpc"
	    "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure"

        pb "github.com/iter8-tools/iter8/abn/grpc"
    )
    ```

### Instantiate a gRPC client

Instantiating a client to the service implementing the SDK API is language specific.

=== "Node.js"
    ```javascript
    var client = new services.ABNClient(abnEndpoint, grpc.credentials.createInsecure());
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
	opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
	conn, err := grpc.Dial(fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", getAbnService(), getAbnServicePort()), opts...)
	if err != nil {
		panic("Cannot establish connection with abn service")
		// return
	}
	c := pb.NewABNClient(conn)
	client = &c
    ```

### Define routing

In the sample, track identifies are mapped to a static set of endpoints. The sample frontends maintain this in a simple map.

=== "Node.js"
    ```javascript
    const trackToRoute = {
        "backend":   "http://backend.default.svc.cluster.local:8091",
        "backend-candidate-1": "http://backend-candidate-1.default.svc.cluster.local:8091",
    }
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
    	trackToRoute = map[string]string{
		"backend":             "http://backend.default.svc.cluster.local:8091",
		"backend-candidate-1": "http://backend-candidate-1.default.svc.cluster.local:8091",
	}
    ```

### Using *Lookup()*

Given a user session identifier, *Lookup()* returns a track identifier that can be used to route requests. 

In this example, the user session identifier is assumed to be passed in the `X-User` header of user requests.

The track identifier is used as an index to the `trackToRoute` map defined above. A default is used if the call to *Lookup* fails for any reason.

=== "Node.js"
    ```javascript
    var application = new messages.Application();
    application.setName('default/backend');
    application.setUser(req.header('X-User'));
    client.lookup(application, function(err, session) {
        if (err || (session.getTrack() == '')) {
            // use default route (see above)
            console.warn("error or null")
        } else {
            // use route determined by recommended track
            console.info('lookup suggested track %s', session.getTrack())
            route = trackToRoute[session.getTrack()];
        }

        // call backend service using route
        ...
    });
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
    route := trackToRoute["backend"]
	user := req.Header["X-User"][0]
    s, err := (*client).Lookup(
		ctx,
		&pb.Application{
			Name: "default/backend",
			User: user,
		},
	)
    if err == nil && s != nil {
		r, ok := trackToRoute[s.GetTrack()]
		if ok {
			route = r
		}
	}

    // call backend service using route
	...
    ```

### Using *WriteMetric()*

In the samples, a single metric named *sample_metric* is assigned a random value between 0 and 100 and written to the metric store. In practice, the metric value should be meaningful.

=== "Node.js"
    ```javascript
    // export metric
    var mv = new messages.MetricValue();
    mv.setName('sample_metric');
    mv.setValue(random({min: 0, max: 100, integer: true}).toString());
    mv.setApplication('default/backend');
    mv.setUser(user);
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
    	_, _ = (*client).WriteMetric(
		ctx,
		&pb.MetricValue{
			Name:        "sample_metric",
			Value:       fmt.Sprintf("%f", rand.Float64()*100.0),
			Application: "default/backend",
			User:        user,
		},
	)
    ```

## Deployment Time Configuration of Backends

The Iter8 A/B/n service watches a set of Kubernetes resource objects. As these objects are deployed or deleted, the service updates an mapping of track label to available version. It is then able to respond to *Lookup()* and *WriteMethric()* requests.

The resource objects watched are specified at A/B/n service deployment time. For further details, see [above](#deploying-the-implementing-service). Recall that Iter8 requires that Kubernetes objects adhere to a naming convention.

y convention, the track name must be `app-candidate-<index>`. Furthermore, all Kubernetes objects that comprise the new version should be named using this track name (ie, `app-candidate-<index>`) and should have the label:

```yaml
app.kubernetes.io/version: v
```

If the deployed resources satisfy the above requirements, the Iter8 A/B/n service will observe the new resources and, when they are ready, begin to include the new track in respoonses to the *Lookup()* call.
